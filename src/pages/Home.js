                I’m <strong>Kelsey!</strong> I'm a passionate developer studying Computer Science at Dalhousie
                University. Throughout my life I have always had a passion for art and design which has inspired
                my interest in <strong>Front-End</strong> development.
            </p>
            <p className="lead">
                Although Front-end is my main interest, I plan to strengthen my <strong>Back-End</strong> and <strong>Network Security</strong> skills 
                through future study and personal projects. I absolutely love learning
                new skills and one of my favorite things about this field is that you can never truly stop learning!
